A zero-maintenance/batteries-included panel manager inspired by VSCode style/aspect that adds via Material-UI (5) elements a self populating/managed and state keeping organization of generated children status bar elements, panels, shortcuts and more.

A root level ```ContextAPI``` driven provider/wrapper that allows for the creation of status bars with a variety of elements that can be clicked or have a menu attached to them. The status bar is a ```self organizing``` manager that can be placed on either end of the screen and can be configured to even feature consoles and other elements.

There are 2 hooks provided for snackbar population/cleanup: ```handleSnackbarRegister``` and ```handleSnackbarCleaning```.

```
import { useRegisterSnackbar } from 'mui-industrial'


export default function () {
  const { handleSnackbarRegister, handleSnackbarCleaning } =  useRegisterSnackbar()

  const generateInfoNotification = (message = 'Sample Info Notification') => {
    handleSnackbarRegister({
      message,
      source: 'AutoFixer',
      severity: Severity.INFO,
    })
  }

  const cleanAllNotifications = () => {
    handleSnackbarCleaning()
  }

  return <>
    <button onClick={generateInfoNotification}>Create sample notification</button>
    <button onClick={cleanAllNotifications}>Clear all notifications</button>
  </>
}

```

The ```handleSnackbarRegister``` allows you to create a snackbar that will be displayed on the screen.
