A zero-maintenance/batteries-included panel manager inspired by VSCode style/aspect that adds via Material-UI elements a self populating/managed and state keeping organization of generated children panels.

A root level ```ContextAPI``` driven provider that allows for the creation of status bars with a variety of elements that can be clicked or have a menu attached to them. The status bar is a ```self organizing``` manager that can be placed on either side of the screen and can be configured to even feature consoles and other elements.
